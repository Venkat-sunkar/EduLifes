<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of us have grown up being taught the importance of education. But why is education important? Through your frustrating school years, you may have thought that it was a waste of time, or was just something that you needed to do in order to get a job. Truth be told, however, education goes so much beyond just getting a job and making your parents happy. In fact, it’s one of the most powerful tools out there.</p>

<h2>What Is Education?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Education means studying in order to obtain a deeper knowledge and understanding of a variety of subjects to be applied to daily life. Education is not limited to just knowledge from books, but can also be obtained through practical experiences outside of the classroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Top 10 Reasons: Why Is Education Important?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many different understandings and definitions of what education is, but one thing can be universally agreed upon, which is the importance of education — and here’s why.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Provides Stability</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Education provides stability in life, and it’s something that no one can ever take away from you. By being well-educated and holding a college degree, you increase your chances for better career opportunities and open up new doors for yourself.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Provides Financial Security</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>On top of stability, education also provides financial security, especially in today’s society. A good education tends to lead to a higher paying job, as well as provide you with the skills needed to get there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Needed For Equality</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order for the entire world to really become equal, it needs to start with education. If everyone was provided with the same&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/blog/all-of-your-options-for-going-to-college-for-free/">opportunities to education</a>, then there would be less gaps between social classes. Everyone would be able to have an equal chance at higher paying jobs — not just those that are already well-off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Allows For Self-Dependency</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The importance of education is evident when it comes to being self-dependent. If we are we educated, then it’s something that belongs to us, and only us, allowing us to rely on no one else other than ourselves. It can allow you to not only be financially independent, but also to make your own choices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Make Your Dreams Come True</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you can dream it, you can achieve it. An education is the most powerful weapon you can possibly have, and with it, you can make all of your dreams come true. There are of course certain exceptions, depending on what you’re aiming for, but generally an education will take you as far as you’re willing to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. A Safer World</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Education is something that’s not only needed on a personal level, but also on a global level, as it’s something that keeps our world safe and makes it a more peaceful place. Education tends to teach people the difference between right and wrong, and can help people stay out of risky situations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Confidence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being self-confident is a major part of being successful in life. And what better way to gain that confidence than with an education? Your level of education is often considered a way to prove your knowledge, and it can give you the confidence to express your opinions and speak your mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. A Part Of Society</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In today’s society, having an education is considered a vital part of being accepted by those around you. Having an education is believed to make you a useful part of society, and can make you feel like a contributing member as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Economic Growth On A National Level</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An educated society is crucial for economic growth.

With a more educated population, more employment opportunities are opened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
