<h2>About the Indian Education System</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A major shift in the education system can be observed since the pre and post-British rule till today in India. Initially, children were educated in Gurukuls which was later modified and the modern education system was introduced.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After India became independent, the constitution committed six fundamental rights, of which one was the Right to Education. It allowed free education for every child up between the age of 6 and 14 years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The education system is mainly divided into pre-primary, primary, elementary and secondary education, which is followed by higher studies.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there are many drawbacks and loopholes in this system which if curbed can work for the overall development of the country.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Current Issues in Education in India</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Discussed below are the current issues with the Education system in India:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Expenditure on education –</strong>&nbsp;More funds should be allotted for the development of the education system in India. In the past few years, many beneficial steps have been taken in this direction and if the same is continued India may soon be overcome the current challenges</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Gross enrolment pattern as followed by the UN must also be adapted by India</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Capacity utilisation –&nbsp;</strong>The world now needs creative minds and the Government must encourage schools to boost the students and utilise their capacities to the max and not let their ideas go unheard</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Infrastructure facilities –&nbsp;</strong>Better infrastructure must be provided especially in Government schools. Since Government is now focussing on digital education, they must undertake steps to provide all necessary facilities in the Government schools and rural areas as well</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>PPP model –&nbsp;</strong>Well-designed PPPs can create models of innovation for the school system in India. Thus the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model must be taken into consideration</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Student-teacher ratio –</strong>&nbsp;The number of students in search of proper education is way more in comparison to the teachers and faculty available. Thus, qualified teachers must be appointed to impart knowledge to the future of the country</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Accreditation and branding –</strong>&nbsp;quality standards</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Students studying abroad –&nbsp;</strong>There are many students who choose to study abroad because of these issues in the Indian education system. The concerned authorities must work on them and students must also choose to stay, learn in India and empower the country through their knowledge</li>

<p><strong>INDIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few simple solutions which can help in overcoming the problems with the India Education System:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Innovations required –&nbsp;</strong>India is moving towards digital education. This will help in budding the innovative minds of students and the youth of the country. This will bring a transformation in the Indian education system and the authorities and Government must encourage and boost the young minds to focus on overall development rather than just the book-learning</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Quality of education –&nbsp;</strong>There is a major difference in the quality of education being provided in the rural and urban areas of the country. Steps must be taken to standardize the quality of education across India so that everyone can get equal and unbiased knowledge and opportunities to grow</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Making education affordable –&nbsp;</strong>There are Government schools and educational Institutions which are affordable but lack in terms of infrastructure and quality. On the other hand, there are various private education institutions which demand high fees and have better infrastructure and equipment to study. This disparity must be worked upon and the Government must make education affordable and accessible for all&nbsp;</li>
